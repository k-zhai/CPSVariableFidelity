# Multi-Fidelity Network Simulation

From VUSE website:
>Cyber-Physical systems are engineering systems where the functionality emerges from networked interactions among the physical and computational components. Thus for simulation based evaluation of CPS, communication network simulation is a central piece that must almost always be integrated with rest of the heterogeneous simulations. In such large-scale CPS simulation based studies, the actual mechanism by which certain network effects such as cyber-attacks, or packet delays and drops, becomes less important as compared to the overall impact of such effects. For that to be simulated along with large CPS simulations, it becomes highly expensive to simulate communication networks at packet levels through all the OSI layers. At the same time, for certain effects to be simulated that is exactly is necessary. In order to balance the increased efficiency of higher-level network simulation with high-fidelity of packet-level simulation, we propose to create an architecture that allows the simulators to dynamically vary the fidelity level of the network simulation during run-time. The key research challenges that we want to address in this project are: (1) to develop, using an open-source simulation tool, a network simulation architecture that enables varying the network model's fidelity levels during run-time, (2) to maintain consistency of network data during such transitions, and (3) generate use-cases to demonstrate both the feasibility and applicability of this approach.

In simulating such networks, we utilize the INET open-source framework and the OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator.
